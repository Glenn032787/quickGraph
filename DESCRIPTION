Description: The goal of quickGraph is to create a functions that helps researchers 
    quickly fit a model on a data set and visualize the data alongside the model. 
    Additionally the plot will provide basic statistics including the model function, 
    F-statistic and adjusted R-square. Currently, the quickGraph library only has 
    one function, plotLinearModel, which fits and visualize simple linear model 
    and provide correlational statistic.
